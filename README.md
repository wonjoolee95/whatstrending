Watch, read, and see what is trending right now in real time!
What's Trending uses developer's API of YouTube, CNN, and Reddit to display and update the trending posts in real time. 
I created the website from scratch, using HTML, CSS/Bootstrap, and JavaScript. 
In the near future, I plan to add more variety and develop a user-profile system to allow users to build their own subscriptions.
